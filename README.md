Building scalable, production‑grade systems for global users

## About Me

I’m a **senior‑leaning backend engineer and product‑driven founder** who builds systems designed to scale across regions, teams, and regulatory boundaries.

My focus is on **fintech‑grade reliability**, clean architecture, and systems that can comfortably handle **high traffic, high trust, and high consequence workloads**.

I work comfortably across:

* **Laravel (11 / 12)** & PHP 8.2+
* **Go (Golang)** for high‑performance, concurrent APIs
* **Python** for automation, trading systems, and data pipelines

---

## What I’m Currently Up To

* Building **ONELY** — a product‑led link‑in‑bio and identity platform with a strong focus on **organizations, institutions, and monetization**
* Deepening my knowledge in **distributed systems, cloud architecture, and backend scalability**
* Open to collaborating on **fintech, SaaS platforms, developer tools, and infrastructure‑heavy products**
* Exploring better patterns for **multi‑tenant systems, webhook security, and event‑driven architectures**
* Ask me about **Laravel internals, API design, background jobs, Redis, Docker, or system design interviews**
* How to reach me: via GitHub or professional channels
* Pronouns: He/Him
* Fun fact: I care more about how a system fails than how it works on a good day

## ONELY

**ONELY** is a product I’m building with a strong belief that:

* Identity should be **structured, owned, and monetizable**
* Tools should scale from **individuals → organizations → institutions**
* Products should be designed with **business models, not just features**

I approach ONELY with the same discipline I apply to backend systems:

* Clear domain boundaries
* Long‑term scalability
* Pricing and growth baked into the architecture

This founder mindset heavily influences how I design software.

## Tech Stack

**Backend & APIs**

* PHP (Laravel)
* Go (net/http, Gin, Fiber)
* Python (bots, automation, data processing)

**Infrastructure & Data**

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Redis (caching, queues, rate limiting)
* MySQL / PostgreSQL
* Nginx

**Engineering Practices**

* Clean Architecture & SOLID
* RESTful & event‑driven APIs
* Background jobs & async processing
* Production‑first error handling & observability

---

## Open to Opportunities

* **Remote‑first roles (EU / Global)**
* **Fintech, payments, remittance, SaaS, and platform teams**
* Backend‑heavy roles with real system design responsibility

I thrive in environments where:

* Scale matters
* Reliability is non‑negotiable
* Engineers are trusted to think


---

## Philosophy

> “Good systems are boring, predictable, and resilient under pressure.”

I write software that:

* Scales without drama
* Fails loudly and clearly
* Can be maintained by another engineer at 3am
